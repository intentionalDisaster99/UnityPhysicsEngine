# UnityPhysicsEngine# Unity Physics Engine

## Why?
I personally love physics and computer science, so I decided to merge the two of them in this project. It is going to also serve as my honorization project for CS 121 at UAH, though feel free to use it and mess around with it.

## What are your goals?
I hope to end up making this engine able to simulate the movement of the solar system through space, tracing a line behind each planet. 
At the moment, it is merely in the beginning stages of development, so it is only 2D though I have plans to make it 3D, among other things

## Future plans
- [ ] Multithreading
- [ ] Charges of particles
- [ ] Rescaling of the background
- [ ] 3D
- [ ] Being able to change from General Relativity to Newtonian gravity
- [ ] Different Shapes (other than circles)
